## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
-Contrast
1. Agile is iterative and incremental where as waterfall is linear and sequential
2. Agile is highly adaptable to change whereas waterfall is rigid and less adaptable
3. In agile the projects scope keeps on evolving, changes are welcome whereas in waterfall project scope is fized, changes require re-planning
4. In agile there are continuous development phases/ cycles ie (sprints) whereas in waterfall there are defined phases (requirement, design, development, testing, deployment)
5. In agile there is continous feedback from stakeholders whereas in waterfall there is minimal involvement after initial requirements
6. In agile testing is continous, intergrated with development whereas in waterfall testing is done after development is compelete
7. In agile delivery of product is frequent with small releases whereas in waterfall delivery there is only single release at the end
8. In agile there is minimal risk due to incremental chnages whereas in waterfall risk is high since issues are discovered late
9. Agile is best for complex and dynamic projects whereas waterfall is best for well defined, structured priojects

-Advantages of Agile
1. Quick adaptability to changes
2. Continuous user feedback improves qualit
3. Faster delivery with frequent releases
4. Encourages collaboration

-Disadvantages of Agile
1. Requires high client involvement
2. Difficult to predict costs & timelines
3. Can lead to scope creep
4. Less effective for simple, well-defined projects
   
-Advantages of waterfall
1. Clear structure and documentation
2. Easier to estimate time & cost
3. Works well for fixed-scope projects
4. Follows a disciplined, sequential process
   
-Disadvantages of waterfall
1. Difficult to accommodate changes
2. Late-stage testing leads to high risk
3. Delayed delivery until full project completion
4. Limited client input after requirements phase
   
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
-When Agile is more benefitial
1. Software development with changing environments e.g. A mobile app startup developing a new social media platform, where user feedback drives frequent updates
2. Large scale IT and AI projects e.g. A machine learning model for healthcare diagnostics, requiring continuous data updates and performance tuning
3. E-commerce and SaaS platforms e.g. An e-commerce website integrating multiple payment gateways, needing A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts
4. Government and public service chat bots e.g. A Kenyan government AI chatbot for assisting citizens, evolving based on user interactions
5. Game devlopemt and UX-centric applications e.g. A new multiplayer game, where user experience testing determines ongoing improvements

-When waterfall is more benefitial
1. Infrastructure and construction projects e.g. A government IT infrastructure upgrade, where all systems must meet predefined security standards
2. Regulated industries (finance, aeroscope and Health) e.g. A banking software upgrade requiring compliance with financial regulations
3. Manufacturing and embedded systems e.g. A medical device’s embedded software where testing is done after full development to meet safety standards
4. Fixed scope corporate systems e.g. A payroll system for a large corporation, with fixed features and regulatory compliance needs
5. Educational platforms with predetermined requirements e.g. A Kenyan online learning management system for public schools, where requirements are clearly defined upfront

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Establish clear quality standards and requirements
2. Implement Agile Testing & Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
3. Conduct different levels of software testing
4. Use automated testing for efficiency
5. Apply code reviews & pair programming
6. Monitor & maintain quality Post-Release

-Why maintaining high standards is crucial
1. Enhances user experience
2. Reduces cost
3. Ensures security and compliance e.g. in banking, public service, health etc
4. Stregthens reputation
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
-How does defining project scope contribute to successful project planning?
1. Setting clear objectives
2. Managing expectations
3. Preventing scope creep
4. Optimizing resource allocation
5. Improving risk management
   
-What is a workbreakdown structure and why is it useful?
*A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of tasks required to complete a project. It breaks a project into smaller, manageable parts for easier planning and execution
